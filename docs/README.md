You can play games at https://latin-chain.com, but you can also browse data as developer, as easy as send a request to:

https://latin-chain.com/api/get-external-user

Sending by POST {pi_user_code}, example:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
  $.post("https://latin-chain.com/api/get-external-user", data={'pi_user_code': 'rockcesar'}, function(data, status){
    alert("Result: " + data.result + "\nStatus: " + status + "\nData: " + JSON.stringify(data));
  });
</script>
```
